txtbus is a microsocial networking platform, akin to twitter. Right now, it's in it's early alpha stage. 

Requirements:
	Ruby
	Sinatra
	HAML
	MySQL

Run /install to install it on your server.
All data right now should be installed in the root directory, as that's where everything redirects to. Will add more support for alternate directories later!
